🎯 Recently Cracked an OTP Bypass on a Live E-Commerce Site! 🧨
 While digging into the registration flow on an e-commerce platform, I spotted a classic yet critical vulnerability — OTP reflection via Burp Suite! 🚨

🔍 Vulnerability Discovered: OTP Reflection in HTTP Response
 During intercept analysis with Burp Suite, the OTP verification response ("OTP is valid.") was clearly exposed in plaintext — right in the HTTP body.
 I intercepted the request and simply flipped the response from:

{ "status": false, "message": "OTP is invalid." }

{ "status": true, "message": "OTP is valid." }

Then retried with manipulated logic — bypassed successfully, no actual OTP needed from SMS! 🔓

🔥 Root Cause
OTP directly reflected in response.
No strict server-side validation.
Overreliance on client-side trust.

⚠️ Impact
Full account takeover possible.
Fraudulent account creations.
Huge blow to customer trust & platform integrity.

🧠 Takeaways for Devs & Security Teams
✅ Don’t reflect OTPs or sensitive info in responses.
 ✅ Always validate OTPs on the server-side.
 ✅ Harden APIs against client-side manipulation.

💡 Pro Tip:
A simple interceptor and a logic tweak was all it took — never underestimate the small flaws!
 Shoutout to the power of Burp Suite and a bit of curiosity-driven testing.
🛡️ Stay safe, stay sharp!
